/*
    Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous
    two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

    1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

    By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not
    exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

const lastTwo = [1, 2];
let sum = 2;

while (current < 4000000) {
